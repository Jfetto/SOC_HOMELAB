# July 28th 2024 
## Setup for this test session is as follows 
 - Default sliver config
 - http becon and session implant
 - no debug on implants 
 - Vulnerable windows 10 system locally on virtual box 


#### These implants have been placed on to my Virtual box instance, that has all security services disabled (for worse case senario).

#### These implants have been renamed, and as you see I am using limaCharlie to view the files on the VM remotley.

# Running the first impant chess.exe without the sliver server running the http listiner

Lima-Charlie shows the event of the exe running but without the listiner LC does not show it as hostile usuing the defualt settings. 
  
  - Th out put below has been reduced to save space, this is the network connection that the implant attempted to make to the sliver server at my local ip of 192.168.40.65
