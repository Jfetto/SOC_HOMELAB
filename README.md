# A more little About me 
 I am a non-traditional student who has finished a 2-year AAS degree in Cybersecurity and am currently enrolled and working towards a bachelor's degree. I have a very deep interest in how computers and networks run under the hood. I am always eager to learn new things. I also love soldering. I am working on programming as well, currently with C++, C, and Python. If anyone has any feedback, good or bad, I am open to it all.
