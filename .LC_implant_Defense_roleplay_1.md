# LC_implant_reaction // roleplay

## A write up for this roleplay is at the end. 

## Setup for this test session is as follows 
 - Default sliver config
 - http becon and session implant
 - no debug on implants 
 - Vulnerable windows 10 system locally on virtual box 


#### These implants have been placed on to my Virtual box instance, that has all security services disabled (for worse case senario).

#### These implants have been renamed, and as you see I am using limaCharlie to view the files on the VM remotley.

# Running the first impant chess.exe without the sliver server running the http listener

Lima-Charlie shows the event of the exe running but without the listener LC does not show it as hostile.
  
  - The output below has been reduced to save space, this is the network connection that the implant attempted to make to the sliver server at my local ip of 192.168.40.65 from my virtual box at 192.168.40.76

  ```
{
  "event": {
    "COMMAND_LINE": "\"C:\\Users\\admin\\Downloads\\chess.exe\" ",
    "FILE_IS_SIGNED": 0,
    "FILE_PATH": "C:\\Users\\admin\\Downloads\\chess.exe",
    "HASH": "42ab26a895bc25552852461a6b81f60600f028001b5b2f807938df74d5986cdb",
    "NETWORK_ACTIVITY": [
      {
        "DESTINATION": {
          "IP_ADDRESS": "192.168.40.65",
          "PORT": 443
        },
        "IS_OUTGOING": 1,
        "PROTOCOL": "tcp4",
        "SOURCE": {
          "IP_ADDRESS": "192.168.40.76",
          "PORT": 51374
}
```

- with a connection now established from my sliver server and the implant, LC still does not detect any issues.

- But as we can see my LC timelime is getting spammed with events about the connection

## Plan of Defence
- I have good Telemetry on this issue and can start acting on it.
- I have certain proof that chess.exe is malicious. No data has been taken from the endpoint and it only seems like a keep alive signal at this point. I need to add a rule and track this service.
- Starting with the hash of the file 42ab26a895bc25552852461a6b81f60600f028001b5b2f807938df74d5986cdb.
- The event that is being created is a NETWORK_CONNECTION
- Crafting a simple YAMA detection and response rule with

   ```
     # Detection
     event: NETWORK_CONNECTIONS
     op: is
     path: event/HASH
     value: 42ab26a895bc25552852461a6b81f60600f028001b5b2f807938df74d5986cdb

     # Response
     - action: report
       name: SLIVER IMPLANT

     ```
   - I start to see incoming detections based on my rule I created

- I now have alerts coming in about the hash that is trying to make network connections
- We have the IP address and the destination host of the attacker
- At this point, I would quarantine the endpoint, stop the process, download the chess.exe file from the endpoint for further inspection, and then block the IP.


## Write-up

### Report : ID 7292024_12
- Endpoint : "IP_ADDRESS": "192.168.40.76" // "vulnwin.ht.home"
- User : "VULNWIN\admin"
- Infected by
- "DestinationHostname":"parrot.ht.home"
- "DestinationIp": "192.168.40.65"

Endpoint vulnwin.ht.home was infected by a malicious implant, "Chess.exe". This implant was sending out a heartbeat signal every 30 seconds back to IP 192.168.40.65. A detection rule was created to monitor traffic from the endpoint while action was being taken. The process was stopped remotely, and the chess.exe file was removed and downloaded onto a forensic box for further inspection. The endpoint is currently being quarantined.

### Recommendations : Keep endpoint quarantined until the following steps have been taken 
- Wipe hard drives and install a fresh image
- Gather information from user VULNWIN\admin about recently visited sites
- DO NOT let VULNWIN\admin access email from any other endpoint until IT has been able to clear their email of any potential malicious files
- Have user VULNWIN\admin join the monthly "Security Essentials" Zoom workshop. Until then, point them towards the trainings at workforce.com/glubix/securityessentals
